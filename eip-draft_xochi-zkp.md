## Abstract

A standard interface for on-chain verification of regulatory compliance (AML, sanctions screening, anti-structuring) using zero-knowledge proofs. Users generate proofs client-side that attest to compliance with jurisdiction-specific thresholds without revealing transaction amounts, counterparty identities, or screening details. Verifiers confirm proof validity on-chain. No trusted third party or TEE is required.

## Motivation

Public blockchains force a binary choice between transparency and privacy. Transparent execution (Uniswap, CoW Protocol) exposes trades to billions in cumulative MEV extraction. Privacy tools (Tornado Cash) have been sanctioned for lacking compliance mechanisms.

Existing approaches to compliant privacy fall short:

- **View keys** (Railgun, Panther): Trade privately, then reveal raw transaction data to auditors on request. This leaks the data: it is delayed transparency.
- **TEE-based compliance** (various): Rely on hardware trust assumptions that have been broken repeatedly (SGX side channels, key extraction).
- **Compliance-by-exclusion** (Privacy Pools): Prove you're NOT in a bad set. Doesn't prove you ARE compliant with specific jurisdiction rules.

This ERC defines a standard where compliance is proven cryptographically at transaction time. The proof commits to screening results, jurisdiction thresholds, and provider attestations. Regulators verify a proof. They never see the underlying data.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Terminology

- **providerSetHash**: A commitment to the specific set of screening providers and their weights used for a particular compliance proof. Included in each attestation for retroactive verification.
- **providerConfigHash**: A hash of the global provider weight configuration published by the oracle administrator. Versioned on-chain; weight changes push a new entry to the config history.
- **attestation TTL**: The duration (in seconds) for which a compliance attestation remains valid after on-chain recording. Expired attestations remain queryable via `getHistoricalProof()` but are not considered valid by `checkCompliance()`.

### Proof Types

Implementations MUST support the following proof types. Each type corresponds to a separate ZK circuit with its own verification key.

| Type ID | Name           | Circuit           | Public inputs                                                                          | Private inputs                                                 |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x01    | Compliance     | compliance        | jurisdiction_id, provider_set_hash, config_hash, timestamp, meets_threshold            | signals, weights, weight_sum, provider_ids, num_providers      |
| 0x02    | Risk Score     | risk_score        | proof_type (threshold/range), direction, bound_lower, bound_upper, result, config_hash, provider_set_hash | signals, weights, weight_sum, provider_ids, num_providers      |
| 0x03    | Pattern        | pattern           | analysis_type, result, reporting_threshold, time_window, tx_set_hash                   | amounts, timestamps, num_transactions                          |
| 0x04    | Attestation    | attestation       | provider_id, credential_type, is_valid, merkle_root, current_timestamp                 | credential_hash, subject, attribute, expiry, merkle_proof      |
| 0x05    | Membership     | membership        | merkle_root, set_id, timestamp, is_member                                              | element, merkle_index, merkle_path                             |
| 0x06    | Non-membership | non_membership    | merkle_root, set_id, timestamp, is_non_member                                          | element, low_leaf, high_leaf, low/high indices, low/high paths |

### Verifier Interface

The verifier routes proof verification to per-proof-type verification contracts. Each circuit produces a separate verifier via the ZK backend (e.g., `bb write_solidity_verifier` for Barretenberg's UltraHonk).

```solidity
interface IXochiZKPVerifier {
    /// @notice Verify a zero-knowledge compliance proof
    /// @param proofType The type of proof (0x01-0x06)
    /// @param proof The encoded proof data
    /// @param publicInputs The public inputs to the verification circuit (packed bytes32 values)
    /// @return valid Whether the proof is valid
    function verifyProof(
        uint8 proofType,
        bytes calldata proof,
        bytes calldata publicInputs
    ) external view returns (bool valid);

    /// @notice Verify a batch of proofs atomically
    /// @param proofTypes Array of proof types
    /// @param proofs Array of encoded proofs
    /// @param publicInputs Array of public input sets
    /// @return valid Whether ALL proofs are valid
    function verifyProofBatch(
        uint8[] calldata proofTypes,
        bytes[] calldata proofs,
        bytes[] calldata publicInputs
    ) external view returns (bool valid);

    /// @notice Get the address of the verifier contract for a proof type
    /// @param proofType The proof type (0x01-0x06)
    /// @return verifier The verifier contract address (address(0) if not set)
    function getVerifier(uint8 proofType) external view returns (address verifier);
}
```

### Oracle Interface

```solidity
interface IXochiZKPOracle {
    struct ComplianceAttestation {
        address subject;
        uint8 jurisdictionId;
        bool meetsThreshold;
        uint256 timestamp;
        uint256 expiresAt;
        bytes32 proofHash;
        bytes32 providerSetHash;
        bytes32 publicInputsHash;
        address verifierUsed;     // verifier contract address at submission time
    }

    event ComplianceVerified(
        address indexed subject,
        uint8 indexed jurisdictionId,
        bool meetsThreshold,
        bytes32 indexed proofHash,
        uint256 expiresAt,
        uint256 previousExpiresAt
    );

    event ProviderWeightsUpdated(
        bytes32 indexed configHash,
        uint256 timestamp,
        string metadataURI
    );

    event AttestationTTLUpdated(uint256 oldTTL, uint256 newTTL);
    event ConfigRevoked(bytes32 indexed configHash);
    event MerkleRootRegistered(bytes32 indexed merkleRoot);
    event MerkleRootRevoked(bytes32 indexed merkleRoot);
    event ReportingThresholdRegistered(bytes32 indexed threshold);
    event ReportingThresholdRevoked(bytes32 indexed threshold);

    /// @notice Submit a compliance proof and record the attestation
    /// @param jurisdictionId Target jurisdiction (0=EU, 1=US, 2=UK, 3=SG)
    /// @param proofType The proof type for verifier routing (0x01-0x06)
    /// @param proof The ZK proof data
    /// @param publicInputs Public inputs matching the circuit's pub parameters
    /// @param providerSetHash Hash of provider IDs and weights used for screening
    /// @return attestation The recorded compliance attestation
    function submitCompliance(
        uint8 jurisdictionId,
        uint8 proofType,
        bytes calldata proof,
        bytes calldata publicInputs,
        bytes32 providerSetHash
    ) external returns (ComplianceAttestation memory attestation);

    /// @notice Check if an address has a valid (non-expired) compliance attestation
    /// @param subject The address to check
    /// @param jurisdictionId The jurisdiction to check against
    /// @return valid Whether a valid, non-expired attestation exists

    function checkCompliance(
        address subject,
        uint8 jurisdictionId
    ) external view returns (bool valid, ComplianceAttestation memory attestation);

    /// @notice Retrieve a proof for retroactive verification (proof-of-innocence)
    /// @param proofHash The hash of the original compliance proof
    /// @return attestation The original attestation record
    function getHistoricalProof(
        bytes32 proofHash
    ) external view returns (ComplianceAttestation memory attestation);

    /// @notice Get all attestation hashes for a subject in a jurisdiction
    /// @param subject The address to query
    /// @param jurisdictionId The jurisdiction
    /// @return proofHashes Array of proof hashes for historical lookup
    function getAttestationHistory(
        address subject,
        uint8 jurisdictionId
    ) external view returns (bytes32[] memory proofHashes);

    /// @notice Get the current provider weight configuration hash
    /// @return configHash Hash of current provider weights
    function providerConfigHash() external view returns (bytes32 configHash);

    /// @notice Get the current attestation time-to-live
    /// @return ttl Duration in seconds that attestations remain valid
    function attestationTTL() external view returns (uint256 ttl);
}
```

### Jurisdiction Configuration

Implementations MUST publish jurisdiction thresholds openly. Risk scores are expressed in basis points (0-10000 = 0.00%-100.00%).

| ID  | Jurisdiction | Low (bps) | Medium (bps) | High / Filing trigger (bps) |
| --- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 0   | EU (AMLD6)   | 0-3099    | 3100-7099    | >=7100                      |
| 1   | US (BSA)     | 0-2599    | 2600-6599    | >=6600                      |
| 2   | UK (MLR)     | 0-3099    | 3100-7099    | >=7100                      |
| 3   | Singapore    | 0-3599    | 3600-7599    | >=7600                      |

### Attestation Lifecycle

Compliance attestations have a configurable time-to-live (TTL):

- Default TTL: 24 hours
- Minimum TTL: 1 hour
- Maximum TTL: 30 days
- `expiresAt = block.timestamp + attestationTTL` at submission time

`checkCompliance()` MUST return `false` for expired attestations. Expired attestations MUST remain retrievable via `getHistoricalProof()` for proof-of-innocence purposes. The TTL is updatable by the oracle administrator via `updateAttestationTTL()`.

### Provider Weight Publication

Implementations SHOULD publish provider weights as an on-chain configuration hash. Weight changes MUST emit `ProviderWeightsUpdated` with the new configuration hash, timestamp, and an optional `metadataURI` pointing to the full configuration (e.g., on IPFS or Arweave).

Provider configuration MUST be versioned. Implementations SHOULD maintain a history of configuration hashes to support retroactive verification: determining which weights were active when a particular proof was generated. Implementations SHOULD support revoking historical configuration hashes when a configuration is discovered to be flawed. The currently active configuration MUST NOT be revocable.

### Proof Type Routing

Implementations MUST maintain a registry mapping each proof type to a per-circuit verifier contract. Each ZK circuit (compiled separately) produces its own verification key and verifier contract. The main verifier contract acts as a router:

1. Caller specifies `proofType` (0x01-0x06)
2. Router looks up the registered verifier for that type
3. Public inputs are decoded from packed `bytes` to `bytes32[]`
4. The per-circuit verifier's `verify(bytes, bytes32[])` is called

Verifier addresses are updatable to allow circuit upgrades. Implementations SHOULD use a two-step ownership transfer pattern for administrative operations.

### Public Input Validation

Implementations MUST validate public inputs semantically for each proof type before forwarding to the per-circuit verifier. The ZK proof guarantees internal consistency (e.g., that the score was correctly computed from the committed inputs), but the oracle MUST verify that those committed inputs match the expected context (e.g., that the config hash is a known configuration, that the merkle root belongs to a registered set). Without this validation, a valid proof generated for one context can be replayed in a different context.

Public inputs MUST be 32-byte aligned. Implementations MUST reject `publicInputs` where `length % 32 != 0`.

The following validation MUST be performed per proof type:

| Proof Type     | Validated Fields                                                 | Registry                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| COMPLIANCE     | jurisdiction_id, provider_set_hash, config_hash, meets_threshold | Config hash registry         |
| RISK_SCORE     | result, config_hash, provider_set_hash                           | Config hash registry         |
| PATTERN        | result, reporting_threshold, tx_set_hash != 0                    | Reporting threshold registry |
| ATTESTATION    | is_valid, merkle_root                                            | Merkle root registry         |
| MEMBERSHIP     | merkle_root, is_member                                           | Merkle root registry         |
| NON_MEMBERSHIP | merkle_root, is_non_member                                       | Merkle root registry         |

### Proof Result Validation

Each proof type includes a boolean result field (`meets_threshold`, `result`, `is_valid`, `is_member`, `is_non_member`) in its public inputs. A valid ZK proof with a false result means the prover proved they do NOT satisfy the condition (e.g., non-compliant, not a member). Implementations MUST reject proofs where the result field is not `true` (encoded as `bytes32(uint256(1))`). Without this check, a user could submit a cryptographically valid proof of non-compliance and receive a compliant attestation.

The `providerSetHash` parameter in `submitCompliance()` is semantically meaningful for COMPLIANCE proofs, which include it as a caller-supplied public input. RISK_SCORE proofs also commit to a `provider_set_hash` in their circuit public inputs, but this value is embedded in the proof itself and does not come from the caller parameter. For all non-COMPLIANCE proof types, implementations MUST ignore the caller-supplied `providerSetHash` and store `bytes32(0)` in the attestation to prevent injection of arbitrary values.

### Validation Registries

Implementations MUST maintain on-chain registries for values that public inputs are validated against. These registries prevent context-spoofing attacks where a proof generated for one context is submitted in a different context.

**Config hash registry.** Tracks valid provider weight configuration hashes. New hashes are added when the administrator updates the configuration. Historical hashes SHOULD be revocable (see Provider Weight Publication). The currently active configuration MUST NOT be revocable.

**Merkle root registry.** Tracks valid merkle roots for MEMBERSHIP, NON_MEMBERSHIP, and ATTESTATION proofs. Roots MUST be registered by the administrator before proofs referencing them can be accepted. Roots SHOULD be revocable when the underlying set is superseded or compromised.

**Reporting threshold registry.** Tracks valid reporting thresholds for PATTERN (anti-structuring) proofs. Each jurisdiction defines its own reporting threshold (e.g., $10,000 for US BSA). Thresholds MUST be registered before proofs referencing them can be accepted.

### Risk Score Computation

The risk score formula MUST be deterministic and publicly verifiable:

$$\text{RiskScore}_{\text{bps}} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{signal}_i \cdot \text{weight}_i}{W} \times 100$$

where $\text{signal}_i \in [0, 100]$ are provider screening results, $\text{weight}_i$ are published provider weights, $W = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{weight}_i$ is the weight sum, and $N \leq 8$ is the number of active providers. The result is in basis points ($0$-$10000$, i.e., $0.00\%$-$100.00\%$).

Circuits that accept `weight_sum` as a private input MUST constrain it to equal the actual sum of the `weights` array. Without this constraint, a malicious prover could pass an arbitrary denominator to inflate or deflate the computed score.

The ZK proof commits to:

- Signal values (hidden)
- Weights used (public via config_hash, must match published config)
- Resulting score (hidden)
- Whether jurisdiction threshold was crossed (revealed as boolean)

### Hash Function Requirements

Circuits MUST use a collision-resistant hash function for all commitments (provider set hashes, config hashes, Merkle trees, credential hashes). The reference implementation uses Pedersen hash, which is efficient in ZK circuits and available in the Noir standard library.

Pedersen commitments are additively homomorphic over the underlying elliptic curve. This is safe provided:

1. Hash outputs are used only as opaque commitments compared via equality.
2. No circuit composes hash outputs arithmetically (e.g., `H(x) + H(y)`).
3. All hash calls use fixed-arity inputs to prevent length-extension reinterpretation.

Implementations MAY migrate to Poseidon2 when high-level APIs stabilize in the circuit language, as Poseidon2 provides stronger random-oracle properties.

### Non-Membership Proof Security

The non-membership circuit proves that an element $e$ is NOT in a sorted Merkle tree by demonstrating adjacency: there exist two consecutive leaves $l$ and $h$ in the tree such that $l < e < h$.

Circuits that compare elements using fixed-width integers MUST range-check all three values (`element`, `low_leaf`, `high_leaf`) to fit within the comparison width before casting. Without this check, a large field element could wrap when truncated, producing a false non-membership proof.

### Retroactive Flagging

Each compliance proof MUST commit to:

1. Provider IDs used for screening (committed via providerSetHash)
2. Results returned by each provider at proof time (hidden)
3. The oracle's clearing decision (revealed as meetsThreshold boolean)
4. A timestamp binding the proof to a specific block

This enables proof-of-innocence: counterparties to retroactively flagged addresses can present the original attestation (retrieved via `getHistoricalProof()`) demonstrating the address was clean at transaction time. The on-chain record is immutable and independently verifiable.

## Rationale

**Why client-side computation?** Server-side or TEE-based compliance creates a trusted party that can be coerced, compromised, or surveilled. Client-side ZK proof generation means the raw data never leaves the user's device. The verifier learns only the boolean result.

**Why published weights?** "Black box" compliance algorithms invite regulatory skepticism and legal challenge. Publishing weights and thresholds makes the system auditable without compromising individual privacy. When enforcement data reveals a provider consistently misses bad actors, the weight adjustment is transparent.

**Why on-chain attestations?** Off-chain attestations can be forged, lost, or denied. On-chain records are immutable, timestamped, and independently verifiable. This is critical for proof-of-innocence: the proof must be retrievable months or years after the original transaction.

**Why not Privacy Pools inclusion/exclusion proofs?** Privacy Pools prove set membership ("I'm not in the OFAC set"). This ERC proves compliance with specific rules ("my risk score under jurisdiction X is below threshold Y using providers A, B, C"). Set membership is a subset of what's needed for regulatory compliance.

**Why attestation TTL?** Compliance status is not permanent. A user who was compliant yesterday may not be compliant today. Screening providers update their data continuously. The TTL forces periodic re-attestation while keeping the window configurable per deployment context.

**Why six proof types?** Each proof type maps to a separate ZK circuit with distinct constraint logic. Compliance handles the core risk score check. Risk Score provides standalone threshold/range proofs. Pattern detects structuring behaviors. Attestation verifies credentials from authorized providers. Membership proves inclusion in an authorized set (whitelist). Non-membership proves exclusion from a sanctions list via sorted Merkle tree adjacency. This separation keeps individual circuits small and auditable.

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC introduces new interfaces and does not modify existing standards. It is designed to complement ERC-5564 (stealth addresses) and ERC-6538 (stealth meta-address registry) for privacy-preserving settlement, but does not depend on them.

## Related Work

Several existing and emerging standards address compliance, privacy, or on-chain ZK verification. This ERC differs from each in scope, architecture, or trust model.

**ERC-3643 (T-REX).** The ratified compliance token standard for regulated securities, with $32B+ in tokenized assets. ERC-3643 requires identity revelation via ONCHAINID claims verified by trusted issuers. This ERC proves compliance without revealing identity data, provider signals, or transaction amounts. The two standards are complementary: this ERC could serve as a ZK-enhanced identity provider within an ERC-3643 deployment.

**Privacy Pools (0xbow).** Live on Ethereum mainnet since March 2025. Users prove their withdrawal originates from a "clean" deposit set using ZK proofs, with Association Set Providers (ASPs) maintaining approved deposit lists. The Privacy Pools protocol validates the "prove compliance without revealing data" model. However, set membership is a subset of what regulatory compliance requires. This ERC extends the approach to multi-dimensional compliance: risk scoring, anti-structuring detection, credential verification, and membership/non-membership proofs.

**EIP-7963.** An oracle-permissioned ERC-20 that validates token transfers via ZK proofs against off-chain payment instructions (ISO 20022 format), using RISC Zero as the proof system. EIP-7963 gates a single token's transfers through a single oracle with a single proof type. This ERC provides standalone compliance attestations with six proof types, usable by any contract, and is not gated to token operations.

**VOSA-RWA.** A compliance-gated privacy token for real-world assets (Draft, 2026). Every token operation requires dual ZK proofs: a compliance attestation (Groth16/BN254, Poseidon hashing) and a transaction conservation proof. VOSA-RWA and this ERC share the "ZK proof for compliance, no PII on-chain" design, but VOSA-RWA embeds compliance into a specific token standard. This ERC is a standalone oracle whose attestations are reusable across protocols.

**ERC-7812.** A ZK identity registry using a singleton Sparse Merkle Tree (80-level, Poseidon on BN128) with custom registrars for business logic. Deployed on Ethereum mainnet. ERC-7812 provides a general-purpose private statement registry. This ERC could operate as a compliance-specific registrar within ERC-7812, storing compliance commitments in its Merkle tree.

**ERC-8039.** A proof-system-agnostic ZK verification interface for smart accounts (`verifyProof(bytes,bytes) returns (bytes4)`). ERC-8039 standardizes per-relation verifier contracts with a non-reverting return pattern (following ERC-1271). This ERC's per-proof-type verifier routing serves a similar verification role but with domain-specific semantics (proof type routing, batch verification, version history). Each generated UltraHonk verifier in this ERC could be wrapped behind an ERC-8039 adapter for smart account integration.

**ERC-8035/8036 (MultiTrust Credential).** Non-transferable credential anchors with ZK presentation via fixed Groth16 ABI, supporting predicate proofs ("score >= threshold") without revealing raw data. The predicate-proving pattern parallels this ERC's RISK_SCORE proof type. MultiTrust focuses on credential issuance and presentation; this ERC focuses on compliance attestation and retroactive verification.

**ERC-1922.** The original zk-SNARK verifier standard (2019, stagnant). Defines a generic interface for on-chain ZK verification with dynamic arrays for cross-scheme compatibility. This ERC supersedes ERC-1922's approach with per-proof-type routing, UltraHonk support, and domain-specific input validation.

## Security Considerations

**Proof soundness.** The security of the system depends on the ZK proof system used. Implementations MUST use a proof system with at least 128-bit security. Groth16, PLONK, and UltraHonk (Noir/Aztec) are acceptable.

**Provider collusion.** If all screening providers collude, they could issue false clean signals. Implementations SHOULD require attestations from multiple independent providers and weight them based on enforcement track record.

**Timestamp manipulation.** Proofs commit to block timestamps. Block proposers control the timestamp, constrained only to be >= the parent block's timestamp. This is acceptable for compliance windows measured in days. Circuits MUST enforce realistic timestamp bounds (e.g., after 2021-01-01 and before year ~36000) to reject obviously invalid values. This applies to both public timestamp inputs (compliance, membership, non-membership) and private transaction timestamps (pattern).

**Regulatory acceptance.** This standard provides a technical mechanism for ZK compliance. Whether specific jurisdictions accept ZK proofs as sufficient compliance evidence is a legal question, not a technical one. The VARA (Dubai) definition of "anonymity-enhanced crypto" excludes assets with "mitigating technologies" for traceability. This standard provides exactly that technology.

**Front-running the oracle.** Compliance proofs are generated before settlement. An adversary who observes a proof submission could infer a trade is about to occur. Implementations SHOULD batch proof submissions or submit them as part of the settlement transaction to minimize information leakage.

**Administrative operations.** Verifier contract updates and provider weight changes are privileged operations. Implementations SHOULD use a two-step ownership transfer pattern (transferOwnership + acceptOwnership) to prevent accidental transfer to an incorrect address. Critical operations (verifier replacement, TTL changes) SHOULD be timelocked in production deployments.

**Public input validation.** Implementations MUST validate public inputs for every proof type, not just the primary compliance proof. Without validation, a prover can generate a proof for one context (e.g., a lenient jurisdiction's reporting threshold) and submit it for a different context. Specifically:

- ALL proof types MUST validate their boolean result field (`meets_threshold`, `result`, `is_valid`, `is_member`, `is_non_member`) equals `bytes32(uint256(1))`. A valid proof with a false result proves non-compliance; accepting it would record a compliant attestation for a non-compliant subject.
- COMPLIANCE and RISK_SCORE proofs MUST validate `config_hash` against a registry of known configurations.
- COMPLIANCE proofs MUST validate `jurisdiction_id` and `provider_set_hash` against caller-supplied parameters.
- RISK_SCORE proofs commit to `provider_set_hash` as a public input, binding the proof to a specific set of screening providers. This prevents a prover from fabricating signals from unverified providers.
- PATTERN (anti-structuring) proofs MUST validate `reporting_threshold` against a per-jurisdiction registry.
- MEMBERSHIP, NON_MEMBERSHIP, and ATTESTATION proofs MUST validate `merkle_root` against a registry of known roots.
- Unknown proof types (outside 0x01-0x06) MUST be rejected.

**Proof replay prevention.** Proof hashes MUST be keyed on both the proof bytes and the proof type: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(proof, proofType))`. Including `proofType` in the hash ensures that proof uniqueness is scoped per proof type: identical proof bytes submitted for different proof types are treated as distinct proofs.

**Config and root revocation.** Provider configuration hashes and merkle roots SHOULD be revocable. Without revocation, a discovered-to-be-flawed configuration or a compromised merkle tree remains accepted forever. Implementations MUST NOT allow revoking the currently active provider configuration. Provider configuration history SHOULD be bounded to prevent unbounded storage growth (e.g., 256 entries).

**Verifier TOCTOU.** Implementations MUST resolve the verifier address once per submission and use it for both proof verification and attestation recording. A time-of-check/time-of-use gap between address resolution and proof verification could allow the recorded `verifierUsed` to diverge from the actual verifier if a verifier upgrade occurs mid-transaction.

**Batch verification limits.** Implementations MUST enforce a maximum batch size for `verifyProofBatch()` to prevent unbounded gas consumption. The reference implementation uses a limit of 100 proofs per batch.

**Registry idempotency.** Registry operations (registering merkle roots, reporting thresholds) SHOULD be idempotent-safe: re-registering an already-registered value SHOULD revert to prevent accidental double-registration. Similarly, revoking a value that is not registered SHOULD revert.

**Emergency circuit break.** Implementations SHOULD include a pause mechanism that can halt proof submissions (and optionally, verifications) in case of a discovered vulnerability in a ZK circuit or verifier contract. Pausing MUST NOT prevent read access to existing attestations, as these are needed for retroactive verification (proof-of-innocence).

The reference implementation includes binary proof fixtures in `test/fixtures/` for all six proof types. Each fixture contains:

- `proof`: the raw UltraHonk proof bytes (8640 bytes each)
- `public_inputs`: the packed bytes32 public inputs

| Proof Type     | Public Inputs Size   | Witness Summary                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMPLIANCE     | 160 bytes (5 inputs) | Single provider (id=1, weight=100), signal=20, EU jurisdiction, score=2000 bps, meets_threshold=true |
| RISK_SCORE     | 224 bytes (7 inputs) | Single provider (id=1, weight=100), signal=60, threshold proof, bound=5000, result=true              |
| PATTERN        | 160 bytes (5 inputs) | 4 transactions (500/1200/3000/7500), structuring analysis, threshold=10000, clean=true               |
| ATTESTATION    | 160 bytes (5 inputs) | Provider 42, KYC basic credential, expiry=2000000000, current=1700000000, valid=true                 |
| MEMBERSHIP     | 128 bytes (4 inputs) | Element=42, set_id=1, index 0 in 20-level Merkle tree, is_member=true                                |
| NON_MEMBERSHIP | 128 bytes (4 inputs) | Element=50 not in set {10, 100}, set_id=1, sorted Merkle adjacency, is_non_member=true               |

All fixtures use Pedersen hash (Noir stdlib) for in-circuit commitments and Merkle tree construction. Fixtures can be regenerated via `scripts/generate-fixtures.sh`.
